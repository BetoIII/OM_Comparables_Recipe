## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** rules (see `.eslintrc`)
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- Keep functions **small and focused**

### React Components

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow the **component structure**:
  ```typescript
  // Imports
  import { useState } from 'react';

  // Interfaces
  interface MyComponentProps {
    title: string;
  }

  // Component
  export default function MyComponent({ title }: MyComponentProps) {
    // Hooks
    const [state, setState] = useState();

    // Event handlers
    const handleClick = () => {
      // ...
    };

    // Render
    return (
      <div>{title}</div>
    );
  }
  ```
- Use **semantic HTML** elements
- Keep components **reusable** and **composable**

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `PropertyCard.tsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `api.ts`, `xlsExport.ts`)
- Pages: `lowercase.tsx` or `page.tsx` (Next.js convention)

### CSS

- Use **CSS Modules** or **global styles**
- Follow **BEM naming** for class names when applicable
- Keep styles **organized** and **documented**
- Use **CSS variables** for colors and common values

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
